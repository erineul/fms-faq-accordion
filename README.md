## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Currently this was a bit challenging for me since it's been a while since I've coded and I am not really familiar with Javascript. It took me a while to complete this challenge since I know the solution using JQuery but I really wanted to improve in Vanilla JS and in the future, I would like to try this challenge again using React.
